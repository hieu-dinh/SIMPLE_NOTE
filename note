Issues:
VITE and Runtime Variables:

If you're passing VITE_BACKEND_URL as an environment variable during container runtime, it won’t work directly because Vite reads environment variables at build time, not runtime.
This means the VITE_BACKEND_URL you set during docker run won’t affect the already built app in the image.
Nginx Needs to Serve the Variable:

If your app is built with Vite, the backend URL is baked into the build during npm run build. To make it dynamic at runtime, you need a workaround, such as serving the variable through Nginx or a JavaScript file.
Solution: Use Nginx to Inject Environment Variables
Here’s how to adjust your Docker setup to make the BASE_URL dynamic:

1. Modify Nginx Configuration
Update your nginx.conf to serve environment variables. Add this block to include a runtime JS file:

nginx
Copy
Edit
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name localhost;

    root /usr/share/nginx/html;
    index index.html;

    location / {
        try_files $uri /index.html;
    }

    location /env.js {
        default_type application/javascript;
        return 200 "window.env = { VITE_BACKEND_URL: '$VITE_BACKEND_URL' };\n";
    }

    error_page 404 /index.html;
}
2. Update React Code
Adjust your React app to read the VITE_BACKEND_URL from the runtime env.js file:

javascript
Copy
Edit
const getBackendUrl = () => {
  if (window.env && window.env.VITE_BACKEND_URL) {
    return window.env.VITE_BACKEND_URL;
  }
  return "http://localhost:5000/api"; // Fallback
};

export const BASE_URL = getBackendUrl();
3. Build and Use the Docker Image
Build your Docker image:

bash
Copy
Edit
docker build -t simple_note/frontend .
Run the container, passing the VITE_BACKEND_URL:

bash
Copy
Edit
docker run -d -p 3000:80 -e VITE_BACKEND_URL="http://127.0.0.1:5000/api" --name frontend simple_note/frontend
The VITE_BACKEND_URL is now injected dynamically into the env.js file when the app runs.
Alternative Solution (if Build-Time is Acceptable)
If runtime configurability is not strictly required, you can set the VITE_BACKEND_URL during the build process:

Docker Command for Build-Time Variable:
bash
Copy
Edit
docker build --build-arg VITE_BACKEND_URL="http://127.0.0.1:5000/api" -t simple_note/frontend .
This approach bakes the URL into the app during the build process. However, you lose runtime flexibility.

Final Thoughts
Use Solution 1 if you need runtime flexibility (most common for containerized apps).
Use Solution 2 if your backend URL won’t change after the app is built.
